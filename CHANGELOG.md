## [1.0.8] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Smart Transcoding**: New automatic quality mode that switches bitrate in real time based on active network
  - Detects WiFi vs mobile data via `connectivity_plus`
  - Configure separate bitrates for WiFi and mobile; the app picks the right one automatically
  - Live connection badge (WiFi / Mobile pill) in Settings → Playback while smart mode is active
  - Smart mode toggle persists across restarts
- **Dynamic & Custom Accent Colors**: The accent color now propagates everywhere in the app
  - On Android 12+ the wallpaper-derived Material You palette is used automatically (via `dynamic_color`)
  - On all other platforms any color picked in Settings → Display is applied to every widget
  - Eliminated all hardcoded `AppTheme.appleMusicRed` references in settings tabs, mini player, song tiles, cast button, and album artwork shadow
- **iOS Control Center player**: Fixed the player widget shown in the iOS Control Center and Lock Screen
  - Disabled the podcast-style ±15 s skip buttons that were hiding the standard ⏮ ▶/⏸ ⏭ controls
  - Added `MPNowPlayingInfoPropertyMediaType = .audio` and `MPNowPlayingInfoPropertyDefaultPlaybackRate` for correct system content categorization
  - Fixed an artwork caching race condition: concurrent 1-second position updates no longer restart artwork downloads already in progress
- **Server connection retry**: `AuthProvider._verifyConnection()` now retries the ping up to 3 times (2 s backoff) before declaring the server unreachable — handles slow mobile network initialization on launch
- **Retry button on the server-unreachable screen**: A "Retry" button lets users re-attempt the connection without restarting the app (`AuthProvider.retryConnection()`)
- **Localization — Settings strings**: All hardcoded strings in the five Settings tabs are now in `app_en.arb` (~100 new keys covering Playback, Storage, About, Display, and Server sections)

### Changed
- **Loading screen**: The app no longer flashes the login screen while checking the server on startup; `AuthState.authenticating` now shows a centered `CircularProgressIndicator` on a black background
- **Home screen desktop layout**: Improved density and alignment for macOS/Windows/Linux
  - Wider horizontal padding (32 px), larger section headers and album cards (180 px)
  - Song lists render as a compact table (`_DesktopSongRow`) instead of full `SongTile` cards
  - Recent albums (6) and playlists (3) shown instead of 4 and 2
- **Error messages**: Improved error string formatting in `AuthProvider._formatError()` — strips `Exception:`, `Network error:`, and verbose library boilerplate for cleaner display
- **Connection timeout**: Server ping timeout increased from 6 s to 10 s
- **Now Playing screen**: Matrix transforms updated to Flutter 3.41-compatible `scaleByDouble`/`translateByDouble` signatures; `.withOpacity()` replaced with `.withValues(alpha:)` throughout

### Fixed
- **`seekForward`/`seekBackward` events from iOS Control Center**: Added `onSeekForward`/`onSeekBackward` callbacks to `AndroidSystemService` and registered handlers in `PlayerProvider` (clamping backward seeks to `Duration.zero`)
- **Settings tab indicator color hardcoded**: `indicatorColor` and `labelColor` in `settings_screen.dart` now use `Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary`
- **`DjMixerService` removed**: Deleted unused `dj_mixer_service.dart` that was included by mistake; `services.dart` barrel still intact

### Dependencies
- Added `connectivity_plus: ^7.0.0` — network type detection for Smart Transcoding
- Added `dynamic_color: ^1.7.0` — Material You wallpaper color extraction on Android 12+
- Added `path: ^1.9.0`

## [1.0.7] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Spotify-style Desktop UX**: Complete redesign of the PC layout
  - New collapsible sidebar (`DesktopNavigationSidebar`) with 260 px expanded / 72 px collapsed states
  - Sidebar sections: Home, Search, Your Library (scrollable playlist list with Liked Songs shortcut), Settings, Collapse/Expand toggle
  - Settings navigation item restored directly in the sidebar
  - All sidebar strings localised via ARB (`expand`, `createPlaylist`)
- **Artwork Style Editor**: Full custom editor in Settings → Display → Artwork Style
  - **Shape**: Rounded rectangle, Circle, or Square
  - **Corner Radius**: slider (0–24 px), only visible when shape is *Rounded*
  - **Shadow intensity**: None, Soft, Medium, Strong
  - **Shadow color**: Black or Accent (Musly red)
  - Live 108 px animated preview updates in real-time
  - All options persisted to `SharedPreferences` and restored on next launch (awaited before `runApp`)
- **No-artwork placeholder in mobile player**: Songs without cover art now show a clean dark gradient tile with a music note icon and localised "No artwork" label instead of an infinite shimmer loader. Shimmer is still used while the image is actually fetching.

### Changed
- **Desktop player bar accent colors**: All active-state indicators (shuffle, repeat, progress slider, volume slider, favorite heart, lyrics button) now use Musly red
- **Update dialog colors**: Header gradient and download button changed from purple/blue (`#6C5CE7 → #00B4D8`) to Musly red/pink (`appleMusicRed → appleMusicPink`)
- **Desktop lyrics**: Lyrics view now uses `rootNavigator: true` so it covers the full window (sidebar + content + player bar); close button pops from the root navigator correctly
- **React marketing website**: Version number and release date in Hero and Download sections are now fetched live from the GitHub public API (`/repos/dddevid/Musly/releases/latest`) with a 10-minute session cache — no auth token required

### Fixed
- **Library list alignment**: Album/artist tiles in the Library screen now use an explicit `InkWell → Padding → Row` layout so artwork and text align with section headers on all platforms
- **Artwork settings not persisting**: `PlayerUiSettingsService.initialize()` is now `await`-ed before `runApp`, guaranteeing saved values are loaded into notifiers before any widget builds

## [1.0.6] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Jukebox Mode** ([#41](https://github.com/dddevid/Musly/issues/41)): Server-side audio playback via the Subsonic jukebox API
  - New `JukeboxService` wrapping all jukebox API calls (`get`, `start`, `stop`, `skip`, `set`, `add`, `clear`, `shuffle`, `remove`, `setGain`)
  - Dedicated `JukeboxScreen` remote-control UI with now-playing artwork, playback controls, volume slider, and queue list
  - Toggle in Settings → Server to enable/disable jukebox mode
  - "Play on Jukebox" and "Add to Jukebox Queue" options in the song long-press context menu (shown only when jukebox is enabled)
  - Auto-refresh on screen open + 5-second polling to stay in sync with current server state
  - Friendly error screen when the server returns 501 (jukebox not enabled), with setup instructions
- **Genre Support**: Enhanced genre browsing
  - Genres screen now shows song count per genre and a tooltip
  - Genre screen rebuilt with two tabs: Songs and Albums
